     * 6.25 (Prime Numbers) A positive integer is prime if it’s divisible by only 1 and itself. For example,
     * 2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime, but 4, 6, 8 and 9 are not. The number 1, by definition, is not prime.
     * a) Write a method that determines whether a number is prime.
     * b) Use this method in an application that determines and displays all the prime numbers
     * less than 10,000. How many numbers up to 10,000 do you have to test to ensure that
     * you’ve found all the primes?
     * c) Initially, you might think that n/2 is the upper limit for which you must test to see
     * whether a number n is prime, but you need only go as high as the square root of n. Rewrite
     * the
     * program, and run it
     * both
     * ways.
