//     * The application displays the prompt Guess a number between 1 and 1000. The player inputs a first
//     * guess. If the player's guess is incorrect, your program should display Too high. Try again. or Too
//     * low. Try again. to help the player “zero in” on the correct answer. The program should prompt the
//     * user for the next guess. When the user enters the correct answer, display Congratulations. You
//     * guessed the number!, and allow the user to choose whether to play again. [Note: The guessing technique
//     * employed in this problem is similar to a binary search, which is discussed in Chapter 19, Searching, Sorting and Big O.]
